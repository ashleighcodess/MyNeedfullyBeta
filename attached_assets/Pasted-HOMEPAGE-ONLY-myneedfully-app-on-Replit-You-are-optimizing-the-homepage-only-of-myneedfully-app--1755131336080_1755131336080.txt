HOMEPAGE ONLY (myneedfully.app on Replit)

You are optimizing the homepage only of myneedfully.app (Next.js + React + Tailwind deployed on Replit).
Goal: Lighthouse desktop ≥95 across Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO — with zero visual/UX changes.

Non-Negotiable Guardrails

Do not change layout, spacing, copy, or interactions.

Do not change routes, APIs, data shapes, or authentication.

Any risky optimization must be skipped and documented.

Never merge changes without human confirmation.

Workflow (Replit-specific)

Create a new Git branch: perf/homepage-lighthouse-95. Do not push directly to main.

Run a baseline Lighthouse desktop audit against the current live homepage and local dev build. Save JSON results to /perf-reports/homepage/before.

Take a before screenshot of the above-the-fold area for pixel comparison.

Limit all edits to files affecting the homepage route. Leave other pages untouched.

Deploy branch to a Replit preview environment — never directly to production.

Run smoke test checklist (see below) on preview before requesting merge.

Homepage Optimization Targets
1) Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

Identify homepage LCP element; render it ASAP.

If LCP is an image:

Use next/image with priority, proper width/height, and sizes.

Enable AVIF/WEBP; preload only if consistently LCP.

If LCP is text:

Use next/font with subsetting and display: swap.

Prevent font-induced layout shift.

2) Fonts

Replace Google Fonts <link> with next/font.

Subset only needed weights/styles. Remove unused preloads.

3) Images

Convert above-the-fold PNG/JPG to AVIF/WEBP if visually identical.

Replace <img> with next/image; set dimensions or fill+sizes.

Reserve layout space to avoid CLS.

4) JavaScript & Hydration

Dynamically import non-critical, client-only components (next/dynamic, ssr:false).

Tree-shake unused dependencies. Replace heavy libs with lighter alternatives if safe.

5) Third-Party Scripts

Load non-essential scripts with next/script (strategy="afterInteractive" or "lazyOnload").

Remove dormant/unused tags only if 100% certain they are not required.

6) CSS & Tailwind

Ensure Tailwind purge removes unused classes.

Remove render-blocking CSS not needed above the fold.

7) Caching & Compression

Confirm Replit deployment serves static assets compressed (Brotli/Gzip).

Long-cache static assets (/_next/static/*, /public/*).

8) Preload/Preconnect

Preload only LCP asset + critical fonts.

Remove stale/unnecessary preconnects.

9) Accessibility & Best Practices

All images must have descriptive alt text.

Interactive elements must have accessible names.

No mixed content or console errors.

10) SEO

One <h1> per page; correct heading hierarchy.

Keep current <title> and <meta> description.

Ensure canonical link is correct.

Acceptance Criteria

Lighthouse desktop (homepage): Perf ≥95, A11y ≥95, Best Practices ≥95, SEO ≥95.

Core Web Vitals: LCP ≤1.8s, CLS ≤0.01, INP <200ms in local desktop test.

No visual or behavioral changes above the fold.

MUST pass human “visual check = PASS”: Compare preview to live on multiple screen sizes before merge.

Replit Preview Smoke Test Checklist (MUST RUN before merge)

 Load homepage in preview; compare above-the-fold screenshot with live — must be pixel-perfect.

 Click all visible navigation links on homepage; confirm they route correctly.

 Test all visible forms/inputs; confirm no console errors.

 Check that images load without broken links.

 Open dev tools → Network tab; confirm no 404s or missing files.

 Run Lighthouse desktop audit on preview; confirm targets met.

 If any test fails, stop and request human review instead of merging.

Deliverables

PR from perf/homepage-lighthouse-95 to main with a CHANGELOG explaining each change and why it’s safe.

/perf-reports/homepage/before and /perf-reports/homepage/after JSON files + short summary of performance gains.

Screenshot comparisons proving pixel match above the fold.

Rollback instructions for each change.

If any target cannot be safely reached, stop at the highest safe score and list blockers + recommendations.
