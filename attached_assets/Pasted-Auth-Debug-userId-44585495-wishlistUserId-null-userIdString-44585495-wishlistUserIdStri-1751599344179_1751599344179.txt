Help needed to cover the essentials for her and her two children.\n","story":"On June 14th, Amanda and her two children, ages 3 and 7, escaped a devastating house fire that destroyed everything they owned. They’re currently staying with relatives in a small apartment, trying to rebuild from the ground up. Amanda is working full-time but between temporary housing, childcare, and the trauma of the loss, she needs help replacing essential items like clothing, bedding, kitchen tools, and school supplies.\n\nShe’s not asking for luxuries — just the basics to give her kids a sense of normal again. Your help can provide a warm blanket, a plate to eat on, or a backpack for her son who starts school next month.","storyImages":null,"category":"household","urgencyLevel":"high","status":"active","location":"Camden, NJ","shippingAddress":{"city":"Watchung","state":"NJ","country":"US","zipCode":"07069","fullName":"Ashleigh Barnard","addressLine1":"111 Hillcrest Rd","addressLine2":""},"isPublic":true,"isVerified":false,"totalItems":0,"fulfilledItems":0,"viewCount":2,"shareCount":0,"featuredUntil":null,"createdAt":"2025-07-04T03:00:58.889Z","updatedAt":"2025-07-04T03:00:58.889Z"}],"total":1}}
