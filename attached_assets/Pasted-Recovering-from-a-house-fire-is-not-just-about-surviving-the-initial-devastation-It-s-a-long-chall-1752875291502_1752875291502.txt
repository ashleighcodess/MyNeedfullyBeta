Recovering from a house fire is not just about surviving the initial devastation. It's a long, challenging journey. From securing temporary housing and replacing critical documents, to navigating complex insurance claims and emotional trauma, rebuilding your life takes significant time, resources, and community support. While immediate needs are urgent, the road to full recovery can span months or even years. The importance of sustained support and practical assistance long after the immediate crisis has passed cannot be understated. To help guide you through this stressful time, here's a clear, step-by-step guide on what to do next:
Step 1: Ensure Safety First
Immediately evacuate everyone to a safe location.
Call 911 as soon as possible.
Avoid re-entering your home until emergency personnel have declared it safe.
Step 2: Immediate Assistance
Contact trusted family members or friends to secure temporary housing.
Notify your insurance company as soon as possible to initiate your claim.
Step 3: Engage with Emergency Services
Request a copy of the fire report from the responding fire department. You'll need this document for your insurance claim.
Ask the responding police officers for their report or any additional documentation they provide.
Step 4: Document Everything
Take photos and videos of the damage, inside and outside the home, when it is safe and permitted to enter.
Create an inventory of damaged or lost items, including estimates on their value.
Keep all receipts for any immediate expenses, such as clothing, food, and accommodations.
Step 5: Manage Insurance Claims
Work directly with your insurance adjuster provided by your insurance company.
Keep detailed notes of all communications with the insurance company and adjusters.
Be cautious of early low-ball offers or settlement checks from your insurance company. It's important to thoroughly evaluate your losses and get quotes from contractors before accepting any settlement.
Step 6: Beware of "Ambulance Chasers" (Public Adjusters)
Public adjusters may approach you offering assistance. Proceed with caution. 
Public adjusters can be very helpful, but they also have a polarizing reputation. Their job is to negotiate with your insurance company to make sure you receive proper remuneration for the damage.
Verify any public adjusterâ€™s credentials and reputation thoroughly before signing any contracts. Understand their fees and ensure their operations align with state regulations.
Get multiple quotes if you want to proceed with a public adjuster.
Step 7: Professional Remediation Services
Use a trusted, certified remediation company to clean and secure your home.
Ensure the remediation company provides a detailed written estimate and a clear timeline for work completion.
