# URGENT: VPS Blank Screen Fix

## Your Current Problem
Your VPS is serving HTML but it's looking for compiled assets (`/assets/index-CActLCm2.js`) that don't exist.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

**Step 1: Upload the corrected HTML file to your VPS**

Replace your current HTML file with this development-compatible version:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1" />
    <title>MyNeedfully - A Registry For Recovery, Relief and Hardships</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Step 2: Update your VPS files**

```bash
# On your VPS, replace the HTML file:
cd /var/www/myneedfully
cp client/index.html dist/public/index.html

# OR directly edit:
nano dist/public/index.html
# Paste the HTML above
```

**Step 3: Restart your production server**

```bash
pm2 restart myneedfully
```

## Why This Works

Your VPS was looking for pre-compiled assets (`/assets/index-CActLCm2.js`) but serving the development HTML template (`/src/main.tsx`) will work because your server has Vite middleware in development mode.

## Alternative Quick Fix

If you want to push from here:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fixed VPS HTML template for development assets"
git push origin main

# Then on VPS:
git pull origin main
pm2 restart myneedfully
```

This should immediately fix your blank screen issue.
